Domain Ontology for Concrete (DOC)
==================================
This is work in progress.

The Domain Ontology for Concrete is intended to be a domain ontology
for development of concrete.  The intention is to cover all relevant
aspect of concrete development, including:
  - composition & phases
  - mixing design & casting
  - properties
  - characterisation & data treatment

The aim is to support both  modelling and characterisation.


Imported ontologies
-------------------
This ontology builds on top of EMMO and the crystallography and
mechanics domain ontologies. See the following table for version
compatibilies:

| Imported Ontologies     | Version           |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| [EMMO]                  | 1.0.0             |
| [domain-microstructure] | 0.3               |


Obtaining the Concrete Domain Ontology
--------------------------------------------
The Concrete Domain Ontology can be access or opened in Protege
using the following url

    https://w3id.org/emmo/domain/concrete/source

It can also be cloned from its [GitHub repository] using the `git`
command:

    git clone https://github.com/emmo-repo/domain-concrete.git
